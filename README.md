# Predictive Maintenance Model ðŸ”§

This application leverages machine learning to predict the **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)** for industrial equipment. Built with **Streamlit**, it provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions based on input parameters such as product type, humidity, temperature, age, and quantity.


## Key Features
- **Accurate Predictions**: Predicts MTTF using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple and intuitive form-based inputs for users.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant predictions displayed upon submitting inputs.

## System Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - `streamlit`
  - `joblib`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
